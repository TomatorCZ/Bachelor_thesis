Peachpie is a modern compiler enabling the compilation of PHP scripts into .NET.
Blazor is a new part of the ASP.NET platform offering the usage of C\# on a client side due to a new web standard, WebAssembly.
This thesis explores a new approach of execution based on the integration between Peachpie and Blazor.
PHP scripts can be referenced from Blazor and evaluated, but there are many steps to make it work.
We analyzed these steps and designed a solution for inserting these scripts to Razor pages, navigating, and evaluating them.
It results in a library containing helper classes to enable PHP programmers to move the PHP execution to a client side with the advantages of the Blazor environment.
However, the difference of used technologies limits usage possibilities, which are shown by two benchmarks.
