\chapter{Benchmarks}

In this chapter, we present two benchmarks, which explore the used technology limitations.
We introduce the background of the benchmarks, execute them and then evaluate the results.

\section{Rendering}

\section{GD library}

This benchmark tests the effectivity of PHP library, \textit{gdlibrary}, in the Blazor environment.
We prepare a simple script, which creates a blank image with 1920x1080 resolution.
We use \texttt{imagecreatetruecolor} function defined in the library.
Then we measure elapsed time during the function execution by printing the current time before and after the function call.
We compare the results with executing the script in desktop environments, where we use Peachpie and native PHP interpreter.
