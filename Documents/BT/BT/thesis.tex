\def\Abstract{%
Peachpie is a modern compiler enabling the compilation of PHP scripts into .NET.
Blazor is a new part of the ASP.NET platform offering the usage of C\# on a client side due to a new web standard, WebAssembly.
Although there exists a project providing the execution of PHP scripts inside a browser using WebAssembly, this thesis explores a new approach of the execution based on the integration between Peachpie and Blazor.
This exploration aims at enabling PHP programmers to move the PHP execution to a client side with the advantages of the Blazor environment.
However, the difference of used technologies limits usage possibilities.
